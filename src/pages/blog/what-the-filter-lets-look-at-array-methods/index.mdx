## Intro

Every now and then, someone asks what `reduce()` is all about or what's going on with `map()`. This isn't so much a blog post as it is a cheat sheet. If you ever need to know something about a specific `array` method, you can find it here!

## array.filter()

Filter through an `array` and `return` a new array with just the items that you want! Lets say you start with an `array` containing the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` and you only want the items that are bigger than `2`, you would do this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

arr.filter(itemInArray => itemInArray > 2); // [3, 4]
```

Now you have an `array` that just contains the number `3`: `[3, 4]`.

## array.find()

Find is the same as `filter()` but it stops executing as soon as it has found the item you need. It `returns` just the item instead of wrapping it in an `array`. If you want the first item that is bigger than `2`, you would do this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

arr.find(itemInArray => itemInArray > 2); // 3
```

Now you just have `3`!

## array.map()

Runs a `callback` on every item in an `array` and `returns` a new `array`. If you want every item to be doubled, you would do this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const newArray = arr.map(itemInArray => itemInArray * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
```

`newArray` is now an array with `[2, 4, 6]`!


## array.reduce()

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.reduce(
    (result, itemInArray) => result = result + itemInArray,
    0
); // 6
```

## array.push()

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.push(10); // 4 because it returns the length of the array after pushing the new item.

// arr now equals [1, 2, 3, 10].
```

## array.concat()

```js
    const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

    arr1.concat(arr2); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## array.shift()

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.shift(); // 1, returns the first value

// arr now equals [2, 3].
```

## array.some()

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.some(itemInArray => itemInArray > 2); // true
```

## array.every()

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.every(itemInArray => itemInArray > 2); // false
```

## array.flat()

```js
const arr = [
    [1, 2],
    [3],
    [4]
]

arr.flat() // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## array.forEach()

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.forEach(itemInArray => {
    // Do something with each item in array
});
```

## array.join()

```js
const arr = ["What", "the", "filter?"];

arr.join("."); // "What.the.filter?"
```

## array.entries()

**What does this even do lmao**
