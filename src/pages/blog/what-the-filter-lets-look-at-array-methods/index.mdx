## Intro

Every now and then, someone asks what `reduce()` is all about or what's going on with `map()`. This isn't so much a blog post as it is a cheat sheet. If you ever need to know something about a specific `array` method, you can find it here!

## array.filter()

Filter through an `array` and `return` a new array with just the items that you want! Lets say you start with an `array` containing the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` and you only want the items that are bigger than `2`, you'd do this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

arr.filter(itemInArray => itemInArray > 2); // [3, 4]
```

Now you have an `array` that just contains the number `3`: `[3, 4]`.

## array.find()

Find is the same as `filter()` but it stops executing as soon as it has found the item you need. It `returns` just the item instead of wrapping it in an `array`. If you want the first item that is bigger than `2`, you'd do this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

arr.find(itemInArray => itemInArray > 2); // 3
```

Now you just have `3`!

## array.map()

Runs a `callback` on every item in an `array` and `returns` a new `array`. If you want every item to be doubled, you'd do this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const newArray = arr.map(itemInArray => itemInArray * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
```

`newArray` is now an array with `[2, 4, 6]`!

## array.reduce()

I get asked the most about `reduce()` so I'll try to add multiple examples for this one. If you have any questions, [Send me a DM!](https://twitter.com/Jordy_vD_)

Reduce is a great way to `reduce` 😉️ an `array` of values into one value. `reduce()` takes 2 arguments; the first `argument` is a `callback` that takes the current result as the first `argument` and the current item in the `array` as the second. The second `argument` to `reduce()` is your starting result.

Let's say you have an `array` of values that you'd like to add up into one value, you could do it like this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.reduce(
    (result, itemInArray) => {
        return result + itemInArray
    },
    0
); // 6
```

Now you have the value `6`!

As you can see, we start with the value `0`. We then loop through `arr` and add every item in `arr` to the value. The `return` value of the `callback` is used in the next iteration. If you were to `return` `2` in your callback, the next loop's `result` would be `2`.

You can `reduce` an `array` into any value you'd like. It's not limited to numbers:

```js
const arr = ["This", "is", "a", "string"];

const concatenatedString = arr.reduce( //  This is a string
    (result, itemInArray) => {
        return `${result} ${itemInArray}`
    },
    ""
);
```

`concatenatedString` is now a variable with `This is a string`!

## array.push()

Append a value to the end of an `array`.

<Tip variant="note">

`push()` mutates your `array` in place! this means the input array is changed without copying it.

`push()` returns the `length` of the `array` after appending the value. It does not `return` a new `array`!

</Tip>

If you'd like to append the number `10`, you'd do it like this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.push(10); // 4 because it returns the length of the array after pushing the new item.

```

`arr` is now an `array` with `[1, 2, 3, 4]`!

## array.concat()

Concatenate multiple `arrays` into one `array`:

```js
    const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

   const concatenatedArray = arr1.concat(arr2); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

`concatenatedArray` is now an `array` with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`!

<Tip>

You can also use the spread operator (`...`) if you prefer. you'd do it like this:

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

const concatenatedArray = [...ar1, ...arr2]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

</Tip>

## array.shift()

`returns` the first value in an `array` and then removes it from that `array`.

<Tip variant="note">

`shift()` mutates your `array` in place! this means the input array is changed without copying it.

</Tip>

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const value = arr.shift(); // 1, returns the first value

```

`arr` now equals `[2, 3]`, `value` equals `1`.

<Tip>

If you just want to remove the first value in an array, you can also use [array.splice()](#arraysplice)

</Tip>

## array.splice()

Removes items from an `array` and optionally adds new items as well. `returns` the removed items and mutates the `array` in place.

<Tip>

`splice()` mutates the array in place and does not copy the original array.

</Tip>

If you'd like to remove the first item from an `array`, you'd do it like this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const result = arr.splice(0, 1);
```

`result` is now `[1]` because `1` is the number that was removed from `arr` and `arr` is now `[2, 3]` because `splice()` mutates the original `arr`. You can also add items to an `array` at a specified `index`:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const result = arr.splice(2, 1, 4, 5);
```

`arr` is now `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and result is `[3]` because `3` is the value that was removed.

## array.slice()

Removes items in an `array` and `returns` a new `array` with the remaining items. `slice()` cannot add items to an array.

If you'd like to remove the first item from an `array`, you'd do it like this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const result = arr.slice(0, 1);
```

`arr` is still `[1, 2, 3]` because `slice()` creates a copy of your `array` before altering it. `result` is `[1]` because `1` is the number that was removed from `arr`.

<Tip>

You can use `slice()` to  create a copy of an array like this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const copy = arr.slice();
```

Because you didn't provide any arguments, nothing was removed and `slice()` just `returned` a copy. You can also use the spread operator to copy an `array`:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const copy = [...arr];
```

</Tip>

## array.some()

`returns` `true` if at least one value in the provided `array` matches your expression. If you'd like to know if your `array` contains the number `2`, you'd do it like this:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const result = arr.some(itemInArray => itemInArray === 2); // true
```

`result` is `true` because `arr` does contain the number `2`.

<Tip>

`array.some()` is a neat replacement for situations where you'd `filter()` through an `array` and check if the `length` of the resulting `array` is higher than `0` to determine if a value exists:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

const result = arr.filter(itemInArray => itemInArray === 2).length > 0; // true
```

</Tip>

## array.every()

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.every(itemInArray => itemInArray > 2); // false
```

## array.flat()

```js
const arr = [
    [1, 2],
    [3],
    [4]
]

arr.flat() // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## array.forEach()

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.forEach(itemInArray => {
    // Do something with each item in array
});
```

## array.join()

```js
const arr = ["What", "the", "filter?"];

arr.join("."); // "What.the.filter?"
```

## array.entries()

**What does this even do lmao**
