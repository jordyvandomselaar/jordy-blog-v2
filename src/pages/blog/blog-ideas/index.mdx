## Intro

This page contains some ideas for me to write blog posts about. Have something that you'd like to know more about? Let me know! You can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jordy_vD_).

Note: This doesn't mean I'll write about everything in here. They're just ideas.

### Be a teacher, not a grumpy dev
